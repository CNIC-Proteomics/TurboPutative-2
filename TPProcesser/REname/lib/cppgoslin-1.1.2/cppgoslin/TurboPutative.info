1) make install in Goslin
    - Generate .so
    - Generate includes (.hpp) of parser and domain
    - Complete src with all .cpp (parser and domain)

2) Copy .hpp (includes) and .cpp. Ignore .so.
    - We are interested in the .cpp of the src and in includes generated after installing
    - Compile all these .cpp indicating the path to includes (-I)

3) Some files are generated during installation so be careful...
